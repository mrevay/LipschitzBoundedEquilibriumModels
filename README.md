# StableEquilibriumNetworks

This code is was used to generate the experiments in the paper "Lipschitz bounded equilibrium networks" https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01732. 

The code is based on the code originally written by Winston and Kolter https://github.com/locuslab/monotone_op_net
and provides a more flexible model class and the ability to enforce lipschitz bounds on the networks.
